## Project Overview

**System Name**: Stepwise PDF Parser with Human-in-the-Loop Validation  
**Objective**: Extract structured data from any format PDF with 100% accuracy guarantee  
**Approach**: Multi-step AI processing with human validation at each stage  

## Core Principles

## System Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

```
PDF Input → Step 1: Structure Classification → Human Validation → 
Step 2: Field/Header Identification → Human Validation → 
Step 3: Data Extraction → Human Validation → JSON Output
```

### Template Optimization
- **Single-Page Validation**: Human validates one representative page
- **Batch Application**: Template applied automatically to remaining pages
- **Exception Handling**: Flag pages that don't match template for review

### Step 3: Data Extraction and Validation

**LLM Tasks:**
- Extract data using validated field mappings
- Apply data type formatting and validation
- Generate structured JSON output
- Flag uncertain extractions for review

**Human Validation Interface:**
- Split-pane view: PDF on left, JSON tree on right
- Click PDF field → highlight corresponding JSON path
- Inline editing of extracted values
- Data type validation indicators
- Bulk correction tools for repeated patterns
- Search and filter capabilities in JSON view
- Export/save functionality

**Output:**
- Final validated JSON with extracted data
